# Math Textbook Page â€“ Redesign
<a href="http://gregoryconrad.github.io/gotopage.html">gregoryconrad.github.io/gotopage.html</a> was a project created by Lexington High student <a href = "http://gregoryconrad.github.io">Gregory Conrad</a> as a way to access the Pearson Textbook Suite in a much faster way. Unfortunately, his website required a redesign, provided by Julian Marmier.
